//NOTE you have to make a script.js file and do all the task in that file.

TASK 1 :
User Interactions (Alert, Confirm, Prompt)

Use alert to greet the user.
Ask the user if they want to enter their information via confirm.
If they confirm, use prompt to get their age and log a message based on the input.

TASK 2 : Functions

Write a declared function calculateArea that takes the radius and returns the area of a circle.
Test "hoisting" by logging the function call before its declaration.

TASK 3 : 
 Non-Primitives (Array and Object)

Create an object student with properties like name, age, and an array courses containing the subjects they study.
Use both dot notation and bracket notation to access and modify properties.

TASK 4: 
Global Object and Window Methods :

Try logging the window object and see what properties are available.

Use prompt to take user input for the studentâ€™s name and add it to the student object created in Task 3.

Task 5 : 
Truthy and Falsy Values

Write a function checkValue that takes an input and prints whether it's truthy or falsy.
Test it with different values like an empty string, 0, NaN, a non-empty string, and numbers other than zero.

Task 6 : 
Determine Access Level Based on User Role and Age
Create a program that grants different access levels to users based on their role and age.

Prompt the user for their role (can be "admin", "editor", "viewer").
Prompt the user for their age.

Use nested if-else statements to determine the access level:

If the role is "admin", grant "full access" if the age is 18 or above. Otherwise, deny access.
If the role is "editor", grant "edit access" if the age is 18 or above; if not, grant "limited access."
If the role is "viewer", only grant "view access" regardless of age.
For any other role, deny access.
Afterward, convert this logic into a switch statement.

Task 7 : 

After completing all the above task  ,you have to create a remote repo on the github then you have to push the script.js file on the github..
